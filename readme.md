# ABF Plotter
This is basically a wrapper around the excellent
[pyabf](https://github.com/swharden/pyABF) package. Point the script to your
abf files and it will automatically generate and save a plot for each, with
colored bars indicating the barrel currently used. This is very specific to
my lab's setup, honestly not sure who else would want to use it.

You can also save the basics (X, Y, and barrel) to a csv for analysis in a different
package.
